# AR-MidAirTarget


Hi! This repository contains an android based augmented reality application which was built using Vuforia, Unity and android SDK. The functionality of this app is to track a mid air object which is floating in the air. When user touches screen, a drone (vuforia core sample assets), a plane (available from store) is placed in mid air and each object has a script for basic rotation animation.
